# Decision: Defer Parsed Register Projections

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Applies to:** Dipole v0.2.4
**Gate:** Gate 6 (discussion-only)

---

## Context

Dipole v0.2.4 introduces **explicit snapshot requests** (Gate 5), establishing
observation as a first-class, explicit user action.

With raw register snapshots now admitted as immutable events, the project
considered whether to introduce **parsed register projections** — structured,
human-readable interpretations of register snapshot payloads.

This discussion was scoped as **Gate 6 (discussion only)** and explicitly did
not authorize implementation.

---

## Decision

**Parsed register projections are deferred.**

They are not introduced in v0.2.4.

---

## Rationale

Parsed register projections are conceptually downstream of the kernel and can be
made non-authoritative. However, they are **not yet architecturally safe** due to
missing interpretive context.

Specifically:

* Register parsing is inherently **architecture-coupled**.
* Correct interpretation requires immutable facts such as:

  * target architecture / triple
  * register set definition
  * pointer width
  * endianness
* These facts are **not currently present in the event log**.

Without this context captured as immutable events:

* parsing becomes dependent on the host environment or debugger state,
* replay determinism is undermined,
* parsed output risks becoming “truth by convenience,”
* the kernel’s **raw-first contract** is weakened indirectly.

Deferring avoids introducing ambient assumptions that cannot be replayed,
audited, or challenged.

---

## Architectural Constraints Reaffirmed

The following constraints remain binding:

* Parsing must live strictly **downstream** of the kernel.
* Parsed data must be explicitly labeled as **derived and non-authoritative**.
* Errors, ambiguity, and absence must be represented as data.
* No parsed output may influence Controller behavior, DebugSession contents,
  observation policy, or execution flow.
* No semantic inference (execution state, stop reason, causality) may arise from
  parsed registers alone.

---

## Implications

* Gate 5 stands complete and sufficient for v0.2.4.
* No UI or projection work depends on parsed registers at this stage.
* Future work on parsed projections must be preceded by a solution for capturing
  **immutable architecture metadata** in the event log.

This decision intentionally prioritizes **replayability, correctness, and
architectural sanity** over near-term convenience.

---

## Notes for Future Agents

* Never parse registers based on host defaults or debugger formatting quirks.
* Never assume register meaning without explicit, versioned context.
* Never treat parsed output as truth.
* If required interpretive context is missing, the correct action is to defer.

Deferral here is a success condition, not a failure.
