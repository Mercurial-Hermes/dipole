How Dipole Teaches

Dipole is not just a debugger. It is an instrument for learning — built on the belief that debugging is learning.

In v0.2, Dipole provides a semantic foundation for understanding systems. The act of teaching — guidance, sequencing, explanation — is delivered through Dojo, which consumes Dipole’s outputs and turns them into structured learning experiences.

Every architectural decision in Dipole exists to support pedagogy downstream.

## 1. Reveal the Invisible
Programs appear flat. Systems are not.

Dipole makes invisible structure observable by capturing truth as Events and deriving meaning through semantic projections.

In v0.2, Dipole reveals structure via:
- event-sourced execution history
- snapshot events carrying raw system state
- semantic projections that derive meaning deterministically
- replayable Frames that can be examined, scripted, and compared

Dipole does not yet “explain” — it exposes. Explanation is layered on by Dojo.

Understanding begins with visibility. Dipole ensures that what is visible is truthful, stable, and replayable.

## 2. Prefer Clarity Over Abstraction
Abstractions are useful only once you understand what they hide.

Dipole deliberately avoids:
- implicit behavior
- hidden state
- authority in UI layers
- interpretation without provenance

Instead, Dipole offers:
- explicit semantic identities (ProjectionId@version)
- pure, deterministic projections
- opaque payloads where meaning is not yet earned
- read-only consumers that cannot mutate truth

This discipline is pedagogical: learners can trust what they see. Dojo builds explanations on top of this clarity — never instead of it.

## 3. Build Understanding Through Small Steps
Dipole grows through experiments, not monoliths.

Each experiment:
- isolates a single concept
- observes real system behavior
- records insight
- promotes understanding into architecture

This same structure guides learning:
- Dojo lessons are small, focused, and composable
- each lesson explores one semantic idea
- learners progress vertically, not horizontally

Dipole teaches the way systems are learned: incrementally, honestly, and without shortcuts.

## 4. Encourage Mental Models
Debugging is not about inspecting values — it is about forming mental structure.

Dipole’s architecture reinforces this by making meaning explicit and stable:
- events explain what happened
- projections explain what it means
- frames explain what is safe to consume

Dojo uses these guarantees to help learners build:
- intuition for execution flow
- understanding of state change over time
- confidence in causal reasoning
- trust in replay and comparison

Temporary facts fade. Mental models endure.

## 5. Human + Machine Collaboration as Method
Dipole is built through disciplined collaboration between:
- human intent, judgment, and curiosity
- machine assistance for acceleration and reflection

This is also how learning happens in Dojo:
- the learner asks questions
- the system provides observable truth
- explanations are layered deliberately
- understanding emerges through iteration

Dipole does not replace thinking. It supports thinking — by making the machine legible.

## 6. Dojo: Where Teaching Happens
Dipole v0.2 is a semantic engine, not a classroom.

Dojo is where:
- lessons are structured
- narratives are introduced
- outputs are contextualized
- learners are guided step-by-step

Dojo uses Dipole’s guarantees to ensure that:
- demonstrations are reproducible
- lessons can be replayed
- mistakes are safe
- understanding compounds

Dipole provides truth. Dojo provides teaching.

---

## Pedagogical Commitment
Dipole exists to make deep understanding:
- accessible
- structured
- trustworthy
- lasting

It does not chase clever UI tricks. It builds foundations strong enough to teach from.

Debugging is learning. Dipole ensures that learning rests on truth. Dojo ensures that truth becomes understanding.
