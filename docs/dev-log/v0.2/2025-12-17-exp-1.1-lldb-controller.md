## Overview

- v0.1 had implicit control spread across main + REPL
- No single authority to:
  - Serialize commands
  - Define lifecycle semantics
  - Refuse invalid actions
- v0.2 requires brokered control → Controller is the first cut.
  - a design goal is for splitting out tmux panes for pedagogical benefit - this can be an uplift over lldb
  - we still need an authoritative controller to broker the interaction with the lldb subprocess
  - tmux pty in each pane can then talk to the controller
  
## Goals

- lay the foundation for the Controller with tests passing
- centralise `execRaw` which is a command passed to lldb
- elevate session lifecyle to a first class state
- draw a hard boundary - _after exit nothing will execute_

## Non-goals
- No tmux
- No IPC
- No gold views
- No async stop events

## Tests
- Exit detection via real LLDB + /usr/bin/true
- Post-exit command refusal

## Result
- Dipole now has a “brain”
- Everything else becomes a client

That write-up will pay dividends later when you explain Dipole to others.
